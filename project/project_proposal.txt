Project Proposal


The project will be worked on solely by myself. I will be building a screen
capture utility to create images from a computer desktop. The user will be
able to capture the entire desktop, a selected window, or a selected area;
each of these different captures can be done by either clicking on their
respective buttons or via a keyboard shortcut. The user will be able to set
some options, like a default save directory.

The project will be written in Racket using the Racket Graphical Interface
Toolkit.
