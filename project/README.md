# Project Proposal
Due before class on __Tuesday, October 24th__

## Project Guidelines
The student is required to complete a course project in order to demonstrate their mastery of the course material.

The student should carefully select their project. The project should be relevant to the course – in particular, since the course is about graphical programming, the project should be mostly GUI code by weight. At the same time, however, the project should be _interesting_ or _useful_ – there should be a clearly-defined practical objective that the project is trying to achieve, as opposed to simply being a GUI exercise. Finally, the project should simultaneously be of a sufficiently ambitious scope to be a semester project for a senior-undergraduate or graduate course, while at the same time being of a sufficiently _limited_ scope that the student or students can practically finish the project in the time remaining.

Students may work alone, or in groups of up to four. However, note that larger groups of students should attempt more ambitious projects. As a rule of thumb, as students are added to a group, the project should get progressively more ambitious, such that each indiviidual student is still doing roughly as much work as they would have done on an individual project.

In addition to the project itself, students will be required to prepare a (short) write-up and a (short) presentation. While these should not consume a significant portion of the “project time,” they will require _some_ additional effort, and students should account for this while planning their projects.

## Project Proposal
To ensure that students are in a position to start working soon, they should prepare and submit a project proposal. The project proposals _do not_ need to be long, but they should clearly indicate

    1. What the objective of the project is, including what specific features the project should support
    2. What platform the students will be working with (i.e., Java Swing, WPF, QT-on-Linux, etc.)
    3. Who will be in the project group

These proposals should be submitted on Desire2Learn. Students are encouraged to begin working on their projects as early as possible, so students are encouraged to submit their project proposals early, and to discuss their projects with the professor, either during class breaks, by email or during the professor's office hours.

The proposal is not for a grade.
